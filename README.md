I made this managed C# library in order to bring you a better abstraction of the native library HTMarch.dll provided by Hantek.

Note my C# library is using unsafe code to call the low level functions of the original library.

I have passed sometimes to explore the functioning of the library and I hope it will help you on all development you plan with this oscilloscope.
